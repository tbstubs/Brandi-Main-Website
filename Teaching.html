                    As a teacher, I aim to instill inspiration and self-motivation into my students by using a positive and encouraging approach to education. I shape my teaching toward each student’s individual needs, because I believe that every student has the potential to grow. I strive to help the students identify achievable goals for which to aim as well as teach them know how to attain such goals for the future.

                    When learning music, I believe that we not only attain knowledge of proper technique and musicality, but a door opens that allows us to know more about ourselves, whether it is discovering how we learn, or learning concepts that we can apply outside of music. I wish for my students to discover perseverance and dedication through striving for improvement on our instrument.
